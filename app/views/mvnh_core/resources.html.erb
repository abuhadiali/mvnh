		<h5>Something with slightly broader coverage to start with. The Surrey Wildlife Trust has been producing a wonderful series of "Wildlife Atlases" over the last years. They have been extremely well received and provide valuable coverage  of Surrey's wildlife. Being atlases, of course they contain distribution maps of the various species they cover. So they help enormously in finding out in detail what is  resent in Mole Valley. Buy them while you can. Follow this link to find out more about the <a href="http://www.surreywildlifetrust.co.uk/Default.asp?mainmenu=homepage&EntityID={EDE97F38-9621-4074-BB13-FEFBDC91987F}">Surrey Wildlife Atlases</a>.</h5><br />

		<h5>As with all things, you will learn about Mole Valley's wildlife most effectively if you walk the district in the company of an intelligent friend who knows the area well. If you can't find one, then <a href="http://www.field-studies-council.org/juniperhall/"> Juniper Hall</a>, a local centre run by the Field Studies Council, has an excellent supply of intelligent friends. They offer weekend and week long courses on all sorts of aspects of natural history. They use Mole Valley, as well as other areas in Surrey, for their field work.</h5>
